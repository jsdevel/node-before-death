# before-death [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]
> Do something before the death of a process.

`before-death` registers a callback for the following events:

* `exit`
* `uncaughtException`
* `SIGHUP`
* `SIGINT`
* `SIGTERM`

Registered callbacks are never called more than once.

##Example

````javascript
var beforeDeath = require('before-death');

beforeDeath(function(err, code, signal){
  //err exists if an uncaughtException event occurred.
  //code exists if an exit event occurred.
  //signal exists if one of SIGHUP, SIGINT, or SIGTERM was received.

  //do something

  //Always call this in case a signal was recieved.  If you don't, then
  //you're process may live on!  You've been warned.
  process.exit();
});
